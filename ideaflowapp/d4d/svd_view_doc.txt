How to use SVDView to visualize the d4d Analogy Space Matrix
Lieberman and Fry, Dec 15, 2012

- In the file d4dcc.py, use the instructions for the method
  write_svdview_files
  to generate the .coords and .names files needed by SVDview.

- Install the "processing" programming environment on your computer from the
  processing.org website.
  We have testing this with version 1.5.1. It might work with version 2.
  On Windows we've unzipped the processing-1.5.1/ folder at top level on the C drive.
  On the Mac, the folder will be in /Documents/Processing/
  
- Put the svdview folder under that folder, ie under "processsing".

- Move the .coords and .names files created by the function d4dcc.write_svdview_files 
  from the d4d folder to the folder
  processing/svdview/data/
   
- Launch the processing IDE. On windows do this by double cliciing on
  processing/processing.exe
  
- In the processing ide, open the file processing/svdview/svdview.pde

- In the SVDview processing window, click on the triangle icon at top left.

- This will open a new large window titled "svdview" and a dialog box.
  The dialog box let's you navigate to your .coords file. 
  Navigate to the processing/svdview/data/ folder and select the .coord file and open it.
  
- The choose file window disappears.
  In the svdview window you should now see a black background with concepts and
  lines in "3D". Use the mouse to drag the background to see different parts of the space.
